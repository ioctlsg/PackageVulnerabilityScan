# SSH-Github-setup for MacOS

1) cd ~   // go to home directory
2) mkdir .ssh // make default ssh directory for key and config
3) ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "{I.am.so.cool@your.email.com}" // create rsa key pair

```bash
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:iMHGJn4XkVaJaIfmtA88wV88888888YeyLSTOxcZU {I.am.so.cool@your.email.com}
The key's randomart image is:

4) ls ~./ssh  // check if keypair is created
5) less id_rsa.pub // copy your pub key to https://github.com/settings/keys
6) ssh -T git@github.com //test ssh key with github

```bash
The authenticity of host 'github.com (100.200.300.400)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbp88888880zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
